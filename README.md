# LICENSE.d

`LICENSE.d` is a collection of "add-ons" to common Open Source software licenses, to be included as named files in a `LICENSE.d` directory, along with the original, unmolested `LICENSE` text.

- [NONO](https://github.com/berneout/nono). Allows distributing copies without preserving copyright and other notices.  Turns MIT, BSD-2-Clause, and similar into something close to [FPL-1.0 / 0BSD](https://spdx.org/licenses/0BSD).

- [IO](https://github.com/berneout/io). Declares maintainers' expectation that contributors will license their work on the same public license terms.  A bit like section 5 of [Apache-2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

- [NOSRV](https://github.com/berneout/nosrv).  Makes double-extra-clear that the Open Source software license doesn't obligate contributors to provide ongoing services to anyone.

## Be Warned!

**Licenses are prescription-strength legal devices, and messing with them is risky business.  If you have serious questions about how you should license your software, consult a lawyer.**

**Do _not_ put confidential information about you, your work, or your clients in issues or pull requests.  Do _not_ ask for legal advice on GitHub, or try to disguise requests for legal advice as general questions or hypotheticals.  You don't want legal advice from anybody dumb enough to fall for that.**
